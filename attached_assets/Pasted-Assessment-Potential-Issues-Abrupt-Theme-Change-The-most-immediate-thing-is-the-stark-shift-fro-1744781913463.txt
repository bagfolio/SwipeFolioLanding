Assessment & Potential Issues:

Abrupt Theme Change: The most immediate thing is the stark shift from the dark theme of the previous sections to this very light theme. Without a smooth visual transition (like a gradient section or animated background change), it can feel disjointed, like landing on a different page.
Visual Hierarchy Confusion: You have the main headline block ("We're building something different"), then the three core vision cards ("Learn," "Practice," "Empower"), and then another section below ("COMING SOON" with "Where finance meets your life...") which also seems to have three points/cards. This creates visual competition and makes the flow less clear. Which set of three points is more important? The lower section feels a bit tacked on.
Generic Card Design: The cards themselves (both the main three and the smaller "Coming Soon" ones) are very plain white rectangles. They lack personality and visual interest. They look like standard template elements rather than part of a "stunning" or "different" design. The icons are simple outlines, and the "Learn more >" links are tiny.
Static Feel: Like the previous sections (in static form), this lacks dynamism. The layout is very symmetrical and centered. It needs motion and interaction to feel engaging, especially for a Gen Z audience.
Weak Connection: It doesn't strongly feel like the "Hope" part of the emotional journey coming after the "Recognition" of the Problem section. The visual language changes significantly, weakening the narrative thread.
Better Guidance / Suggestions for Improvement:

Smooth the Theme Transition:
Gradient Section: Consider adding a section between Problem and Vision that uses a background gradient to smoothly transition from dark to light.
Consistent Elements: Carry over some subtle background elements (like abstract shapes or refined versions of the lines from the other concept) from the dark theme into the light theme sections, adapting their color/opacity. This creates continuity.
Elevate the Main Vision Cards (Learn, Practice, Empower):
Make them Pop: Redesign these cards significantly. Give them:
Subtle Backgrounds: Instead of plain white, use a very light tint of the brand's teal, a subtle internal gradient, or a soft texture.
Refined Borders/Shadows: Use soft, layered shadows or subtle, perhaps slightly rounded borders to make them lift off the page.
Engaging Icons: Make the icons larger, potentially filled or two-toned using the brand palette, or use more unique custom illustrations/SVGs.
Clearer CTAs: Style the "Learn more >" links as small, attractive buttons or more prominent text links with clear hover states.
Hover Animations: Add satisfying framer-motion hover effects (e.g., slight scale-up, shadow deepen, icon animation, background shimmer).
Rethink or Integrate the "Coming Soon" Section:
Clarify Purpose: Is this essential for the initial landing page vision? If so, integrate it better.
Combine/Reformat: Could these points ("Smart insights," "Value alignment") be incorporated within or directly below the main "Learn/Practice/Empower" descriptions instead of being a separate block?
Visual Differentiation: If kept separate, style this section differently to avoid looking like just another row of cards. Maybe use a different background color (a light grey or subtle teal tint) or present the points as a checklist or short paragraphs. Style the smaller cards consistently if kept.
Inject Motion & Dynamism:
Entry Animations: Use framer-motion's whileInView to animate the headline, sub-headline, and cards as they enter the viewport. Stagger the animation of the three main cards for a more dynamic effect.
Scroll Effects: Consider subtle parallax effects on background elements or the cards themselves as the user scrolls.
Strengthen Brand in Light Theme: Ensure the brand colors (#6FCFC3, #4CB0A3, #2A6F79) are used effectively for headlines, icons, buttons, links, and highlights against the light background to maintain brand identity.
